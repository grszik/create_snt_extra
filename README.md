# Create: Sweets 'n' Treats (_Reforged_)

Unofficial version of S&T for Forge. Keep in mind this is not a 1:1 copy, but a remake - some recipes or item names/ids might be different.

## Foods

Offers Muffins, Donuts, Pies, Rock Candy, Gumdrops, Sugar Cookies, Cinder Bread, Cinder Rolls and Gunpowder Cakes (definitely safe to eat). The first three also have different flavours: Apple Syrup, Sweet, Honeyed and Chocolate.

## Decoration blocks

Added in v1.1.0, this mod offers standard, chiseled, polished and bricks versions of Rock Candy blocks and smooth, polished, column, chiseled, chiseled bricks, trapdoor and door versions of Chocolate blocks.

## Dependencies

Requires the [Create mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create/), at least version 0.5.1.

## Other

### Why a different version?

The original version for Forge is really broken, not to mention it's not uploaded to Modrinth and is only on CurseForge. For example it does not have the Apple Syrup at all and some recipes are just simply broken. It even crashes my game sometimes. This version aims to fix it, being created from scratch. Also this one is open source!

### How do I check recipes?

Just use [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi)
